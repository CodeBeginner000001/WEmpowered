                  WEmpower Foundation was created to combat misogyny and support
                  women facing challenges like domestic violence, low-wage jobs,
                  and limited autonomy in Masjid Moth. Many mothers struggle to
                  advocate for their childrenâ€™s education due to long work hours
                  and limited resources, often leading to school withdrawals due
                  to poverty or gender bias.

                  Our programs provide mothers and children with resources,
                  leadership skills, and advocacy tools, strengthening family
                  bonds and promoting gender equality. Together, we envision a
                  future where both mothers and children have the resources and
                  opportunities to thrive.
