          WEmpower Foundation was created to combat misogyny and support women
          facing challenges like domestic violence, low-wage jobs, and limited
          autonomy in Masjid Moth. Many mothers struggle to advocate for their
          childrenâ€™s education due to long work hours and limited resources,
          often leading to school withdrawals due to poverty or gender bias.

          Our programs provide mothers and children with resources, leadership
          skills, and advocacy tools, strengthening family bonds and promoting
          gender equality. Together, we envision a future where both mothers and
          children have the resources and opportunities to thrive.
